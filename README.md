# Git Large File Support Is Required!

Please note that this repo contains large data files required to reproduce 
the analysis. If you do not have Git LFS installed, you will only get the 
soft links to these files, not the files themselves, when you clone the 
repo. That is fine, unless you want to reproduce the analysis (as opposed 
to just reviewing the code).

Luckily, LFS support is easy to install. See here: https://git-lfs.github.com

# What is here

Supporting analysis scripts and data for our LMNA manuscript drug repurposing 
manuscript. Pre-rendered document is included in this repository 
(`data_analysis.html`), or the figures may be reproduced from the provided data 
files by executing the code blocks in  data_analysis.Rmd 
(or "knitting" the document from RStudio). 

Please see the "pre-requisites" section prior to running analysis to ensure 
required packages are installed.
